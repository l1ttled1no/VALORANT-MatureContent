# Mature Content Copying Files

This project contains scripts to copy mature content files for VALORANT if the 'Mature Content' option is not enabled in the game for some accounts (Vietnam/Australia/etc Region).

Give a Star if you found this project interested. 
## Description

The provided scripts will:
1. Check if the required data files exist.
2. Verify the destination path from a `path.txt` file.
3. Copy the necessary files to the destination path.
4. Remove the copied files from the destination path.

This trick is needed for some account which cannot accessed to enable the Mature Content in General menu.

## Usage
1. Make sure you have press the **UPDATE** button in the game (disable the Auto-Update for Valorant is recommended)
2. Ensure you have the required data files (`MatureData-WindowsClient.pak` and `MatureData-WindowsClient.sig`) in the `data` directory.
3. Update the `path.txt` file with the correct destination path.
4. Run the `main.bat` script to execute the process. You can run the `test.bat` also, but this batch file was translated from the `main.ps1` file by GitHub Copilot (I have not verified it yet). 
## Disclaimer

**DISCLAIMER:** I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE IF THE ACCOUNT IS BANNED FOR USING THIS TRICK, AS I HAVE BEEN DOING IT SINCE SEPTEMBER 2022 AND HAVE NOT BEEN BANNED.

MODIFICATION ON GAME FILES CAN LEAD TO AN SUSPENSION. 

THE DATA FILES IN THIS PROJECT ARE OBTAINED FROM AN U.S VALID RIOT ACCOUNT.
