# Mature Content Copying Files

This project contains scripts to copy mature content files for VALORANT if the 'Mature Content' option is not enabled in the game.



## Description

The provided scripts will:
1. Check if the required data files exist.
2. Verify the destination path from a `path.txt` file.
3. Copy the necessary files to the destination path.
4. Remove the copied files from the destination path.

## Video tutorial how to use this batch

## Usage
1. Make sure you have press the **UPDATE** button in the game (disable the Auto-Update for Valorant is recommended)
2. Ensure you have the required data files (`MatureData-WindowsClient.pak` and `MatureData-WindowsClient.sig`) in the `data` directory.
3. Update the `path.txt` file with the correct destination path.
4. Run the `main.bat` script to execute the process. You can run the `test.bat` also, but this batch file was translated from the `main.ps1` file by GitHub Copilot (I have not verified it yet). 
## Disclaimer

**DISCLAIMER:** I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE IF THE ACCOUNT IS BANNED FOR USING THIS TRICK, AS I HAVE BEEN DOING IT SINCE SEPTEMBER 2022 AND HAVE NOT BEEN BANNED.
